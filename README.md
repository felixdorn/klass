# Klass for Laravel

Klass extracts your dynamic classes in your Blade components to a file that PurgeCSS can process.

The plugin for Laravel Mix can be found [here](). (no yet released, still WIP)

## Installation

> Requires [PHP7.4.0+](https://php.net/releases)

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require felixdorn/klass
```

## Usage

```php
// app/View/Components/Button.php
class Button extends Component {
    public string $color;
    
    public function __construct(string $color = 'blue') {
        $this->color = $color;
    }
    
    public function render() {
        return view('components.button');
    } 
}
```

```blade
<!-- resources/views/components/button.blade.php -->
<button class="bg-{{ $color }}-500" {{ $attributes }}>
    {{ $slot }}
</button>
```

```html
<!-- resources/views/welcome.blade.php -->
<x-button color="red"/>
<x-button/>
```

```bash
php artisan klass:extract
```

```text
// storage/framework/extracted-classes.txt
bg-red-500 bg-blue-500
```

You can now add that file to PurgeCSS or a similar tool to include those classes in your final CSS build.

If you use the [Laravel Mix plugin]() (still WIP, not released yet), the last two steps are done automatically.

## Limitations

```php
class Button extends Component {
    public function render() {
        return function ($componentData) {
            return view('components.button', $componentData);
        };
    }
}
```

Returning a closure in `render()` makes it impossible for Klass to extract dynamic classes in the component.

## Tailwind & JIT compilation

Klass works well with the old Tailwind workflow aka use a build with a ton of classes in development and then remove all of
the unused classes in production. However, recently, Tailwind got a JIT compiler to have a production-like css in development.

Klass could work quite easily with the JIT compiler. At compile time, `php artisan klass:extract` should be called but I
have yet to figure out how to do that in a smart way.

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
