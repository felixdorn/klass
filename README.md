# Klass for Laravel

**A stable version that will fix the limitations stated below is in work [here](https://github.com/felixdorn/klass/tree/v1)**

Klass extracts your dynamic classes in your Blade components to a file that PurgeCSS can process.

The plugin for Laravel Mix can be found [here](). (no yet released, still WIP)

## Installation

> Requires [PHP7.4.0+](https://php.net/releases)

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require felixdorn/klass
```

## Usage

```php
// app/View/Components/Button.php
class Button extends Component {
    public string $color;
    
    public function __construct(string $color = 'blue') {
        $this->color = $color;
    }
    
    public function render() {
        return view('components.button');
    } 
}
```

```blade
<!-- resources/views/components/button.blade.php -->
<button class="bg-{{ $color }}-500" {{ $attributes }}>
    {{ $slot }}
</button>
```

```html
<!-- resources/views/welcome.blade.php -->
<x-button color="red"/>
<x-button/>
```

```bash
php artisan klass:extract
```

```text
// storage/framework/extracted-classes.txt
bg-red-500 bg-blue-500
```

You can now add that file to PurgeCSS, or a similar tool to include those classes in your final CSS build.

If you use the [Laravel Mix plugin]() (still WIP, not released yet), the last two steps are done automatically.

## Configuration

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Felix\\Klass\\KlassServiceProvider" --tag="klass-config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
return [
    'components_paths' => [
        resource_path('views/components'),
        base_path('vendor'),
    ],

    'views_paths' => [
        resource_path('views'),
    ],

    'output' => base_path('storage/framework/extracted-classes.txt'),
];
```

## Known Limitations

There might be other limitations that I didn't think of please PR them here, so I can work on them at some point.

### Parameter typed with an abstract class, or an interface not bound to an implementation

TLDR; This means that you can't type an attribute as `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model` or any unbound abstract class
/ interface.

To resolve the type property in the component below, Klass needs to instantiate it.

```php
class Icon extends Component {
    public string $type;
    public function __construct(bool $solid = true) {
        $this->type = $solid ? 's' : 'o';
    }
}
```

So if you type an attribute as an abstract class like `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model`. It would simply ignore use
only the properties and constructor parameters to resolve the attributes. .

Workaround: The only workaround is to allow the type to be nullable to make it so Klass analyse properties defined more dynamically like `$type` in the example above.

### Returning a Closure in `render()`

```php
class Button extends Component {
    public function render() {
        return function ($componentData) {
            return view('components.button', $componentData);
        };
    }
}
```

Returning a closure in `render()` makes it impossible for Klass to extract dynamic classes in the component.

Workaround: None.

## Tailwind & JIT compilation

Klass works well with the old Tailwind workflow aka use a build with a ton of classes in development and then remove all
of the unused classes in production. However, recently, Tailwind got a JIT compiler to have a production-like css in
development.

Klass could work quite easily with the JIT compiler. At compile time, `php artisan klass:extract` should be called but I
have yet to figure out how to do that in a smart way.

## Livewire

Blade components used in a Livewire component are analyzed. However, we do not support Livewire components in itself. I
have no plans to support it before traditional Blade components edge cases are resolved. I'd merge a PR adding support
for it, if you feel like contributing.

## API

This API has yet to be implemented.

```php
$extracted = Klass::extract(Component::class);
$extracted->getCalls();
$extracted->hasCalls();

$component = $extracted->getComponent();
$component->getName();
$component->getClass();
$component->getAttributes();
$component->getDefaults();
$component->getContent();

Klass::listen('event', function () {});
```

So we could add more commands such as `klass:extract` without copy pasting things around and external libraries could
build cool stuff on top of the API.

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
